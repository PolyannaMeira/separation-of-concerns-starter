# Styles

You can use CSS `@import` statements to divide CSS tasks between steps in your
strategy.

CSS imports are not a great professional practice because they are inefficient,
but you'll learn how to fix that later on with build scripts. So for now just
enjoy the convenience.

## CSS Reset

"The goal of a reset stylesheet is to reduce browser inconsistencies in things
like default line heights, margins and font sizes of headings, and so on."

The CSS reset used in this project comes from
